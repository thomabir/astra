# Configuration

## Astra `config.yaml` file

Astra is configured through the `yaml` configuration file `~/.astra/config.yaml` containing the following keys:

| key | value |
| --- | --- |
| `folder_assets` | path of the folder where astra reads and writes data |
| `gaia_db` | path of the local gaia database used by astra to plate solve images (used when pointing)|

Under the assets folder, the following strucure is created:
```
assets
├── images        # where astra saves the images
├── log           # log-related files
├── observatory   # observatory config files
└── schedule      # schedule files
```

Within Python, the configuration can be accessed through the `astra.CONFIG` object.
