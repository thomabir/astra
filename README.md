- **Automated Surveys**: You can schedule and execute automated survey observations using Astra. Define observation targets, parameters, start and end times, and let Astra handle the rest.
- **Alpaca Integration**: Astra leverages the Alpyca python library to provide seamless integration with a wide range of astronomy equipment, permitting easy scalability to multiple telescopes, cameras, domes etc.
