"""
Observatory Control System for Autonomous Astronomical Operations.

This module provides the core Observatory class for managing and controlling
astronomical observatories. It handles device coordination, safety monitoring,
automated observations, and data acquisition for professional astronomical
facilities.

The module integrates multiple subsystems including:
    - Alpaca-compatible device drivers for telescopes, cameras, and accessories
    - Real-time safety and weather monitoring systems
    - Automated observation schedule execution
    - Database logging and FITS header management
    - Thread-safe multiprocessing architecture

Key Components:
    - Observatory: Main control class for observatory operations
    - Device Management: Alpaca protocol device coordination
    - Safety Systems: Weather monitoring and error handling
    - Scheduling: Automated observation execution
    - Calibration: Automated flat, dark, and bias frame acquisition
    - Pointing & Guiding: Telescope pointing correction and guiding

Usage:
    This module is typically used as part of the ASTRA observatory automation
    framework. The Observatory class is instantiated with a configuration file
    and then manages all aspects of observatory operation.

Note:
    This software is designed for professional astronomical observatories.
    Proper configuration of safety systems is essential to prevent equipment
    damage and ensure personnel safety.

        Close the observatory in a safe, controlled sequence.

        Performs the complete observatory shutdown sequence to ensure equipment
        safety and protection from weather. The sequence follows this order:
        1. Stop telescope slewing and tracking
        2. Park the telescope to safe position
        3. Stop any active guiding operations
        4. Park the dome and close shutter (if present)

        For SPECULOOS observatories, includes special error handling and polling
        management during the closure sequence.

        Parameters:
            paired_devices (dict, optional): Dictionary specifying which specific
                devices to use for the closing sequence. Format:
                {'Telescope': 'TelescopeName', 'Dome': 'DomeName'}
                If None, uses all available devices. Defaults to None.

        Execute a pointing model sequence to improve telescope pointing accuracy.

        Generates a systematic series of sky positions and captures images at each
        location to build or refine a telescope pointing model. The sequence creates
        a spiral pattern of points from zenith down to a specified altitude, avoiding
        positions too close to the Moon.

        Parameters:
            row (dict): Schedule row containing sequence information:
                - 'device_name': Name of the camera device
                - 'action_type': Should be 'pointing_model'
                - 'start_time', 'end_time': Sequence timing
            paired_devices (dict): Dictionary of paired devices for the sequence,
                including telescope and camera.

        Action Value Parameters (from row['action_value']):
            - 'n' (int, optional): Number of pointing positions. Defaults to 20.
            - 'exptime' (float, optional): Exposure time in seconds. Defaults to 1.
            - Additional standard action parameters (ra, dec, etc.)

        Process:
        1. Creates pointing_model directory for image storage
        2. Generates spiral pattern of sky coordinates from zenith
        3. For each position (if not too close to Moon):
           - Slews telescope to target coordinates
           - Takes exposure with specified parameters
           - Performs pointing correction to measure error
           - Updates FITS header with correction information
        4. Continues until all positions are captured or conditions change

        Safety Features:
        - Continuous condition checking during sequence
        - Moon avoidance for accurate measurements
        - Error handling for individual pointing failures

        Note:
            - Critical for maintaining high telescope pointing accuracy
            - Results improve automated observation precision
            - Typically run during commissioning or maintenance periods

        Set the exposure time for flat field calibration images.

        This function adjusts the exposure time for flat field calibration images captured with a camera device
        to achieve a specific target median ADU (Analog-to-Digital Units) level, considering user-defined limits. It uses 64x64
        pixel subframes to speed up the process.

        Parameters:
            obs_location (EarthLocation): The location of the observatory.
            paired_devices (dict): A dictionary specifying paired devices, including 'Camera' for the camera device.
            row (dict): A dictionary containing timing information for the flat field calibration.
            numx (int): The original number of pixels in the X-axis of the camera sensor.
            numy (int): The original number of pixels in the Y-axis of the camera sensor.
            startx (int): The original starting pixel position in the X-axis for the camera sensor.
            starty (int): The original starting pixel position in the Y-axis for the camera sensor.
            target_adu (list): A list containing the target ADU level and tolerance as [target_level, tolerance].
            offset (float): The offset ADU level to be considered when adjusting the exposure time.
            lower_exptime_limit (float): The lower limit for the exposure time in seconds.
            upper_exptime_limit (float): The upper limit for the exposure time in seconds.
            exptime (float, optional): The initial exposure time guess. If not provided, it is calculated as the
                midpoint between lower_exptime_limit and upper_exptime_limit.

        Returns:
            exptime (float): The adjusted exposure time in seconds that meets the target ADU level within the specified limits.

        Complete FITS headers with interpolated device data.

        Post-processes captured images by adding dynamic header information that
        wasn't available at exposure time. Uses polled device data to interpolate
        accurate values for each image timestamp, ensuring complete and accurate
        FITS headers for scientific analysis.

        The process:
        1. Retrieves incomplete images from the database
        2. Groups images by camera for efficient processing
        3. Queries polled device data around image timestamps
        4. Interpolates device values to exact exposure times
        5. Updates FITS files with complete headers
        6. Marks images as header-complete in database

        Key Features:
        - Time-interpolated device values for precise timestamps
        - Handles multiple cameras and device types simultaneously
        - Preserves original headers while adding missing information
        - Robust error handling with detailed logging

        Data Sources:
        - Device polling data from database
        - FITS configuration file for header mapping
        - Original image FITS headers for timing information

        Error Handling:
        - Individual image failures don't stop batch processing
        - All errors are logged and added to error_source
        - Database consistency maintained even with partial failures

        Note:
            - Typically run after observation sequences complete
            - Critical for ensuring complete scientific metadata
            - May take significant time for large image sets

        Process multiprocessing queue messages for database operations and logging.

        Continuously monitors the multiprocessing queue for database queries and
        log messages from device processes. Handles different message types and
        maintains system operation by processing database operations and managing
        thread cleanup.

        Message Types Handled:
        - 'query': Executes SQL database queries from device processes
        - 'log': Processes log messages with different severity levels
          - 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'debug' log levels supported
          - Error messages are added to error_source for monitoring

        Background Operations:
        - Cleans up completed threads from the threads list
        - Maintains database consistency across multiprocessing boundaries
        - Ensures proper error propagation from device processes

        Error Handling:
        - Catches and logs queue processing errors
        - Adds queue errors to error_source for monitoring
        - Stops queue processing on fatal errors

        Note:
            - Runs continuously until queue_running flag is False
            - Essential for multiprocessing communication with devices
            - Handles both synchronous database operations and asynchronous logging
            - Thread cleanup prevents memory leaks in long-running operations
