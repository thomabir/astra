"""
Observatory Control System for Autonomous Astronomical Operations.

This module provides the core Observatory class for managing and controlling
astronomical observatories. It handles device coordination, safety monitoring,
automated observations, and data acquisition for professional astronomical
facilities.

The module integrates multiple subsystems including:
    - Alpaca-compatible device drivers for telescopes, cameras, and accessories
    - Real-time safety and weather monitoring systems
    - Automated observation schedule execution
    - Database logging and FITS header management
    - Thread-safe multiprocessing architecture

Key Components:
    - Observatory: Main control class for observatory operations
    - Device Management: Alpaca protocol device coordination
    - Safety Systems: Weather monitoring and error handling
    - Scheduling: Automated observation execution
    - Calibration: Automated flat, dark, and bias frame acquisition
    - Pointing & Guiding: Telescope pointing correction and guiding

Usage:
    This module is typically used as part of the ASTRA observatory automation
    framework. The Observatory class is instantiated with a configuration file
    and then manages all aspects of observatory operation.

Note:
    This software is designed for professional astronomical observatories.
    Proper configuration of safety systems is essential to prevent equipment
    damage and ensure personnel safety.

        Execute a pointing model sequence to improve telescope pointing accuracy.

        Generates a systematic series of sky positions and captures images at each
        location to build or refine a telescope pointing model. The sequence creates
        a spiral pattern of points from zenith down to a specified altitude, avoiding
        positions too close to the Moon.

        Parameters:
            action (Action): Schedule action containing sequence information.
            paired_devices (dict): Dictionary of paired devices for the sequence,
                including telescope and camera.

        Action Value Parameters (from ``row['action_value']``):
            - ``n`` (`int`, optional): Number of pointing positions. Defaults to 20.
            - ``exptime`` (`float`, optional): Exposure time in seconds. Defaults to 1.
            - Additional standard action parameters (``ra``, ``dec``, etc.)

        Process:
            1. Creates pointing_model directory for image storage
            2. Generates spiral pattern of sky coordinates from zenith
            3. For each position (if not too close to Moon):
                - Slews telescope to target coordinates
                - Takes exposure with specified parameters
                - Performs pointing correction to measure error
                - Updates FITS header with correction information
            4. Continues until all positions are captured or conditions change

        Safety Features:
            - Continuous condition checking during sequence
            - Moon avoidance for accurate measurements
            - Error handling for individual pointing failures

        Note:
            - Critical for maintaining high telescope pointing accuracy
            - Results improve automated observation precision
            - Typically run during commissioning or maintenance periods

        Perform telescope pointing correction based on an acquired image.

        Uses plate solving to determine the actual pointing position from a captured
        image and corrects the telescope pointing if the error exceeds the configured
        threshold. Supports both sync-only and slew corrections.

        Parameters:
            action (Action): The action object containing action_type,
                start_time, end_time, and action_value with target coordinates.
            filepath (str | Path): Path to the FITS image file for plate solving.
            paired_devices (PairedDevices): Object containing telescope and other
                devices for the correction.
            dark_frame (str | Path | None, optional): Path to a dark frame for calibration.
                Defaults to None (no dark subtraction).
            sync (bool, optional): If True, only sync the telescope without slewing.
                Defaults to False.
            slew (bool, optional): If True, allows slewing to correct large errors.
                If False, sets pointing threshold to 0. Defaults to True.

        Returns:
            tuple: A tuple containing:
                - bool: True if pointing correction completed successfully
                - WCS or None: World Coordinate System object if plate solve succeeded,
                  None if failed

        Position telescope to optimal sky location for flat field imaging.

        Calculates and moves the telescope to an optimal sky position for capturing
        uniform flat field images. The position is determined based on sun location,
        telescope constraints, and sky brightness uniformity requirements.

        Parameters:
            obs_location (EarthLocation): Observatory geographical location for
                astronomical calculations.
            paired_devices (dict): Dictionary of paired devices including telescope
                and dome for positioning operations.
            action (Action): The action object containing action_type,
                start_time, end_time, and action_value with target coordinates.

        Process:
            1. Calculates optimal sky position based on current conditions
            2. Considers sun position and twilight geometry
            3. Ensures position provides uniform illumination
            4. Commands telescope to slew to calculated position
            5. Updates action_value with target coordinates

        Positioning Strategy:
            - Avoids regions near sun or moon for uniform illumination
            - Selects high altitude positions when possible
            - Considers dome constraints and telescope limits
            - Optimizes for sky brightness uniformity

        Note:
            - Critical for obtaining high-quality flat field calibrations
            - Position affects uniformity and quality of flat frames
            - Coordinates with flats_exptime for complete flat acquisition

            error_sensitive (bool, optional): Whether to abort on system errors.
                Defaults to True.
            weather_sensitive (bool, optional): Whether to abort on unsafe weather.
                Defaults to True.

        Safety Features:
            - Continuous monitoring of weather and error conditions
            - Timeout protection prevents infinite loops
            - Queue management prevents conflicting operations
            - Detailed error logging and reporting

        Note:
            - Uses queue system to prevent overlapping operations on same device
            - Automatically handles different data types and comparison methods
            - Critical for all automated observatory operations
